The above script shows the architecture of the detection model. This script can be used to generate the tflite format of it which can then be benchmarked using the tensorlfow executable
The link to the executable - https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-nightly-public/prod/tensorflow/release/lite/tools/nightly/latest/linux_x86-64_benchmark_model_performance_options

The model can be generated by running - 
```bash
  $ python attack_detection_model.py
```

The model can be benchmarked by running - 
```bash
  $ ./linux_x86-64_benchmark_model --graph=attack_detection_benchmark.tflite
```
